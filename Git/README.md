# Git: Version control tool

**Git**:
- Keep track of the changes that we've made to code
- Synchronize code easily between different people.

**Common Git commands**:
- git clone: Clone a git repository to your local.
- git add: Take a snapshot of specific files and start tracking these files. 
- git commit: Save a snapshot of the current state of the repository.
- git push: Public all the changes in the local repository to the remote repository.
- git pull: Take all the latest changes on the remote repository to the local repository.
- git log: Show all commits.
- git reset: Go back to a previous commit.
- git checkout: Switch to another branch.
- git merge: Merge two different branches together.


**Git Branch**: Work on different parts of the repository at the same time.

**Merge Conflicts**: This is an event that occurs when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code between two commits.
